### U.S. Citizen Applicant Guide ‚Äì 2-3 Week Fast-Track

> This guide shows **U.S. citizens** how to prepare E-2 visa documents in **2-3 weeks** using professional services, ship to Korea for **CCVI** (Certificate for Confirmation of Visa Issuance / **Visa Issuance Number**), and complete the visa process in **5-7 weeks total**.

------

## 0) Quick Win Overview ‚Äì 2-3 Week Document Prep

### Total Timeline: 5-7 Weeks Start to Visa

**Phase Breakdown:**

1. **Week 1-3: Document preparation** (FBI + degree + apostilles) = **2-3 weeks**
2. **Week 4-5: Korea shipping + VIN processing** = **2-3 weeks**
3. **Week 6-7: Consulate visa application** = **3-5 days**
4. **Arrival: Medical check + ARC** within 90 days

### The Only Viable Process

**FBI Background Check:**

- FBI-approved channeler (Accurate Biometrics, Fieldprint): **24-72 hours**
- Monument Visa Federal apostille (rush): **3-5 days**
- ‚úÖ Total: **1 week**

**Degree Authentication:**

- Local notary: **Same day** ($10-30)
- Monument Visa State apostille (rush): **3-5 days**
- ‚úÖ Total: **1 week**

**All documents ready to ship:** **2-3 weeks maximum**

### Two Must-Not-Fail Rules

üî¥ **CRITICAL:**

- **FBI check ‚áí U.S. Department of State (Federal) apostille**
- **Degree copy ‚áí Secretary of State of issuing state (State) apostille**

Mixing these up = automatic rejection. Monument Visa handles both correctly.

### Investment Required

| ------------------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| FBI channeler                  | $40-100      | 24-72hr results vs. 14 weeks     |

**It's the only method that works for real-world hiring timelines.**

Budget for this from Day 1. Consider it mandatory job offer insurance.

## 9) Document Red Flags ‚Äì What Gets Rejected

## 10) FAQ & Common Scenarios

**Q. I have a DUI/misdemeanor. Can I get an E-2 visa?**

A. It depends on severity and type.

**Generally acceptable:**

- Minor traffic violations (speeding tickets, parking)
- Very old non-violent misdemeanors (10+ years ago)

**Usually rejected:**

- DUI/DWI (especially recent)
- Drug offenses (any type, any time)
- Violent crimes
- Crimes involving moral turpitude
- Sex offenses

**What to do:**

- Get FBI check to see what shows
- Be honest on Health Statement
- False declarations = deportation if discovered
- Consider consulting immigration lawyer if concerned

**Q. Can I reuse an FBI check I got 8 months ago?**

A. No. FBI check must be issued within **6 months** of when employer applies for CCVI.

You need a new one. Good news: FBI channeler + Monument Visa = new apostilled FBI check in 1 week.

**Q. What if I'm currently outside the U.S.?**

A. You need a U.S. address for FBI check delivery. Options:

1. Use channeler + U.S. friend/family address
2. Friend/family mails FBI result to Monument Visa
3. Monument Visa ships apostilled docs internationally
4. OR: Fly to U.S. for 2-3 weeks to complete process in person

International logistics add 1-2 weeks. Often cheaper to just visit U.S.

**Q. Can my spouse/kids come with me?**

A. Yes, on F-3 dependent visas. But:

- They need separate visa applications
- Additional documents required (marriage certificate, birth certificates ‚Äì all apostilled)
- They cannot work in Korea
- Consider if single income is sufficient
- Spouse can apply for separate work visa if qualified

**Q. I have tattoos. Will this affect my visa?**

A. Visa: No impact on approval

Employment: Depends on employer

- Public schools (EPIK): Generally okay if coverable
- Private academies: Varies by location (conservative areas may object)
- Kindergartens: May have restrictions

**Best practice:** Disclose visible tattoos to employer before contract.

**Q. Can I work while waiting for ARC?**

A. Technically yes if you entered on E-2 visa ‚Äì BUT you must pass health check first.

Many schools wait for ARC to start contract because:

- ARC needed for payroll
- ARC needed for health insurance enrollment
- Delays = delayed pay

Ask your employer about their policy.

**Q. What if my passport expires during my contract?**

A. Renew at U.S. Embassy in Seoul:

- Location: Sejong-daero, Seoul
- Appointment required (kr.usembassy.gov)
- Processing: 2-3 weeks routine service
- Cost: $130 for renewal

After new passport:

- Update immigration within 14 days
- Bring old + new passports + ARC
- They'll transfer visa info to new passport

**Q. Can I extend my E-2 visa without leaving Korea?**

A. Yes, if renewing with same employer:

- Submit extension 30-60 days before expiration
- Need: new contract, health insurance proof, clean tax records
- Processing: ~2 weeks
- No need to return to U.S.

If changing employers:

- New CCVI + approval process required
- Usually done within Korea

**Q. What if I already started the FBI direct mail process?**

A. **Also** apply through channeler immediately.

Don't wait 14 weeks. The $40-100 channeler fee is cheaper than losing your job offer.

When FBI mail eventually arrives, keep it as backup.

**Q. My degree is from a foreign university, not U.S. Can I apply?**

A. Yes, but requires extra steps:

1. Get credential evaluation from NACES member (WES, ECE)
2. Evaluation must show equivalency to U.S. Bachelor's
3. Evaluation report needs notarization + State apostille
4. Adds ~$200-300 cost and 2-4 weeks
5. Some Korean employers may not accept ‚Äì verify first
